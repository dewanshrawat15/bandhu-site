				The lockdown due to the pandemic took a heavy toll on everyone. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151434/">this article</a> by NCBI, In addition to various psychological problems like depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe threats to the lives and physical health of people around the globe.
				<br><br>
				In response to the problems posed by the pandemic, various public health strategies such as isolation of infected or at-risk persons, reduction of social contact, and simple hygiene like frequent hand wash, have been advised to reduce the risk of infection. Although isolation helps in achieving the goal of reducing infections, reduced access to family, friends, and other social support systems causes loneliness increasing mental issues like anxiety and depression.
				<br><br>
				During such stressful situations, the concerned government, hospitals, educational institutions, organizations, and even individuals need to look into psychological intervention and adopt necessary measures. In addition to educating individuals to stay isolated, it is vital to educate and prepare them to face the mental health issues they may endure during the period.
				<br><br>
				<h2>The problem</h2>
				The COVID 19 lockdown era imposed a lot of restrictions on everyone. People were unable to get out of their homes. People have been forced to stay home for long durations of time. People are unable to socialise, unable to interact with their friends, people addicted to alcohol are unable to get alcohol due to the imposed lockdown. All of it has taken a serious toll on everyone's mental health. We need to be able to connect with people, talk about our problems in an anonyomous way without the fear of being judged, inculcate new hobbies to deal with addictions to live a healthy life. These are a few suggestions as recorded in a medical journal online. I went through these suggestions recommended in the medical journal and decided to build a common platform for all.
				<br><br>
				<h2>The idea</h2>
				The idea was to build one common platform, accessible to everyone, anonymous so that people can connect with each other, talk about it (a small implementation of Clubhouse, managed in an anonymous fashion), maintain an online journal, maintain a checklist of items to do. They should be able to read motivational quotes, inculcate new hobbies, discuss their issues online anonymously. I build a common platform for people to maintain a journal, a checklist of items to do. This lets people deal with anxiety which was on a rise due to COVID. People can read motivational quotes to get motivated, helping them have a better mental state of health. A common platform for users to be able to discuss their daily life problems anonymously. An activity tracker for people to be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A platform for users to be able to learn something new, to keep themselves mentally occupied and lead a mentally healthy lifestyle.
