The lockdown due to the pandemic took a heavy toll on everyone. According to [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151434/) by NCBI, In addition to various psychological problems like depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe threats to the lives and physical health of people around the globe.

### The problem
The COVID 19 lockdown era imposed a lot of restrictions on everyone. People were unable to get out of their homes. People have been forced to stay home for long durations of time. People are unable to socialize, unable to interact with their friends, people addicted to alcohol are unable to get alcohol due to the imposed lockdown. All of it has taken a serious toll on everyone's mental health.

### The Idea
The idea was to build one common platform, accessible to everyone, anonymous so that people can connect with each other, talk about it (a small implementation of Clubhouse, managed in an anonymous fashion), maintain an online journal, maintain a checklist of items to do. They should be able to read motivational quotes, inculcate new hobbies, discuss their issues online anonymously. I build a common platform for people to maintain a journal, a checklist of items to do. This lets people deal with anxiety which was on a rise due to COVID. People can read motivational quotes to get motivated, helping them have a better mental state of health. A common platform for users to be able to discuss their daily life problems anonymously. An activity tracker for people to be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A platform for users to be able to learn something new, to keep themselves mentally occupied and lead a mentally healthy lifestyle.
